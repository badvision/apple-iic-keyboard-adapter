## Module: AY-3600 Emulator

The core emulator module (`firmware/src/ay3600_emulator.c`) is well-tested and stable. Changes to this module require:

1. Clear justification (bug fix, feature request, etc.)
2. Comprehensive unit tests
3. Verification against Apple IIc Technical Reference Manual
4. Hardware testing with actual Apple IIc

## Git Workflow

1. Keep commits focused and atomic
2. Write clear commit messages
3. Rebase on main before submitting PR
4. Squash fixup commits before merge

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues:** Bug reports, feature requests
- **Pull Requests:** Code review and discussion
- **Discussions:** General questions, ideas, showcase

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Provide constructive feedback
- Help others learn

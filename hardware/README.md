# Hardware Design Files

This directory will contain PCB designs, schematics, and hardware documentation.

## Coming Soon

- Schematic (KiCad format)
- PCB layout for ESP32-C3 + level shifters
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Assembly instructions
- 3D printable enclosure designs

## Current Status: Breadboard Prototype

The project is currently at the breadboard prototype stage. See the [design documentation](../docs/DESIGN.md) for circuit diagrams and component specifications.

## Breadboard Setup

For now, use:
- ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 development board
- 2x Adafruit TXB0108 level shifter breakout boards
- Breadboard and jumper wires

See `docs/DESIGN.md` for complete wiring instructions.

## Contributing

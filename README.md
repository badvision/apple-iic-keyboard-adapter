## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install PlatformIO
pip install platformio

# Or via VS Code extension
# https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode
```

### Clone and Build

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/badvision/apple-iic-keyboard-adapter.git
cd apple-iic-keyboard-adapter

# Build firmware
cd firmware
pio run

# Run tests (no hardware needed!)
pio test -e native

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for the AY-3600 emulator:

```bash
cd firmware

# Run all tests on native platform (fast!)
pio test -e native

# Run tests on actual ESP32-C3 hardware
pio test -e esp32c3
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Key press/release handling
- ✅ Modifier keys (Control, Shift)
- ✅ Debouncing logic
- ✅ Key repeat timing
- ✅ Signal generation
- ✅ Edge cases and error handling

## 💡 How It Works

### The Problem

The Apple IIc uses an **AY-3600-PRO-KEY** chip to scan its keyboard matrix and generate key codes. This chip is:
- No longer manufactured (discontinued ~40 years ago)
- Difficult to find replacements
- Incompatible with modern USB/Bluetooth keyboards

### The Solution

Replace the AY-3600 with an **ESP32-C3** microcontroller that:
1. **Emulates** the AY-3600 output signals perfectly
2. **Accepts input** from USB or Bluetooth keyboards
3. **Translates** modern key codes to Apple IIc format
4. **Maintains compatibility** with the original keyboard

### Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐
│ USB/BT      │
│ Keyboard    │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       v
┌─────────────┐    Level      ┌─────────────┐
│  ESP32-C3   │───Shifters───>│  Apple IIc  │
│  (AY-3600   │   3.3V→5V     │ Motherboard │
│   Emulator) │                └─────────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

The ESP32-C3 runs custom firmware that:
- Parses USB/Bluetooth HID keyboard reports
- Maps modern scancodes to Apple IIc key codes
- Generates the exact signals the Apple IIc expects
- Handles debouncing, key repeat, and timing

## ❓ FAQ

### Do I need to modify my Apple IIc?
No! The adapter connects to the existing keyboard port. Installation is reversible.

### Will my original keyboard still work?
The current design replaces the AY-3600, so the original keyboard won't work. However, you could implement matrix scanning to support both simultaneously.

### What keyboards are compatible?
Any standard USB keyboard should work. Bluetooth keyboards require BLE support (most modern keyboards).

### Can I use this with Apple IIe or II+?
The design is specific to the Apple IIc, but could be adapted. The main differences are in the keyboard connector and IOU chip interface.

### How much does it cost?
About $24 for a breadboard prototype, or $32 with a custom PCB.

### Is programming experience required?
Not to use the pre-built firmware! Programming experience helps if you want to customize or contribute.
